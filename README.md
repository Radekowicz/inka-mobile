# Denti

## About the project

The goal of this project was to design and create a system that assists in managing client service in dental office. The system consists of three parts: 
* web app: https://github.com/Radekowicz/inka-frontend
* mobile app: **this**
* backend app: https://github.com/Radekowicz/inka-backend

Web application is intended for employees of dental office, mobile application is created for office's patients.

The biggest advantage of the mobile application intended for the clients of the clinic is the possibility for patients to sign up for the next visit on their own. Details of the visit, such as the type, cost and duration, are set by the office employee on the web application, while the patient in his mobile application only selects the date of the visit.
